Sample Profiles

[LAYDOCK (T&E)]
Mutsu Profile allows relative-path from the location of the profile.  If you have Laydock disk images, and FM77AV40 ROM files, organize files as:

    Laydock.Mutsu (in this folder)
    ROMS/AV
        BOOT_BAS.ROM
        BOOT_DOS.ROM
        FBASIC30.ROM
        INITIATE.ROM
        KANJI.ROM
        SUBSYSCG.ROM
        SUBSYS_A.ROM
        SUBSYS_B.ROM
        SUBSYS_C.ROM
    DISK
        LAYDOCK1.D77
        LAYDOCK2.D77

Then, you can open Laydock.Mutsu, and start LAYDOCK by clicking on "START" button.





[YS2 (Falcom)]
Back in late 1980s, games were released in multiple floppy disks, and very often we had to change disk as the game progresses.

It would be very inconvenient if you need to open file-selector and select a disk-image all the time.

To solve this problem, you can set up image-file aliases, like DISKA for DISK/YS2_A.D77, and DISKB for DISK/YS2_B.D77 etc.

This profile is an example of how to use aliases.  You can start YS2 by putting this profile and disk and ROM images as follows.

    YS2.Mutsu (in this folder)
    ROMS/AV
        BOOT_BAS.ROM
        BOOT_DOS.ROM
        FBASIC30.ROM
        INITIATE.ROM
        KANJI.ROM
        SUBSYSCG.ROM
        SUBSYS_A.ROM
        SUBSYS_B.ROM
        SUBSYS_C.ROM
    DISK
        YS2_A.D77
        YS2_B.D77
        YS2_P.D77
        YS2_USER.D77
